# Easy-AI-Game-Assignments

Easy-AI is a Unity library developed by Steven Rice for the course "Artificial Intelligence for Game," where I worked on a series of assignments focusing on designing various game AI agents. 
This repository provides an overview of the assignments and tutorials I completed during the course.

## Overview

Easy-AI serves as a foundation for learning and prototyping artificial intelligence for games. 
The course assignments aimed to build essential skills leading to the creation of a game involving capture the flag. 

The repository includes the following assignments:

- [Assignment 1](#assignment-1): Agents, Sensors, and Actuators
- [Assignment 2](#assignment-2): Finite State Machines
- [Assignment 3](#assignment-3): Steering Behaviours
- [Assignment 4](#assignment-4): Navigation
- [Project](#project): Goal-Oriented Behaviour

The assignments progressively enhance AI capabilities, starting from basic agent behaviors and culminating in complex team-based game AI for capturing the enemy flag.

## Assignment 1

In Assignment 1, I worked on creating a vacuum cleaning agent tasked with keeping the floor clean. The assignment involved handling dirty tiles, sensors, actuators, and developing a performance measure. 
I also went above and beyond with my creativity to design a different kind of an agent that has similar sensors, actuators and performance measures as the vacuum cleaning agent. This agent was responsible for 
picking up the packages from the map and drop them at a certain location randomly givenly by the auto generated map.

## Assignment 2

Assignment 2 introduced Finite State Machines and tasked me with creating more complex behaviors for microbes. These behaviors included hunting and mating, with the help of provided sensors.
The Finite State Machine that I created for this assignment is as follows :

## Assignment 3

Assignment 3 focused on implementing steering behaviors, enhancing agent movement capabilities, and enabling them to make decisions based on their surroundings.

## Assignment 4

Assignment 4 involved navigation improvements, including corner-graph generation and A* pathfinding, to allow agents to navigate complex environments.

## Final Project

The project involved designing a multiplayer game in Unity where players could activate different agent minds, ranging from free-roaming to combat-oriented behaviors. 
The game also featured enemy AI agents with adaptive behavior based on their surroundings and self-state. This enemy agent is a Goal-Oriented Behaviour agent.
